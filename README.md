# RPSgame
This Rock Paper Scissors game was created as part of the Foundations course assignments in the Odin Project.

The JS was written in an earlier assignment then I added the UI on a separate branch and tried to merge them. However it didn't work and there were loads of files in the repo which didn't belong there so I obviously did something wrong. I deleted the repo and started this new one to upload the finished files.
